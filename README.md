# Profitable apps within the Google Play store and the Apple iOS app store

- I aim to identify which types of apps attract the most users
    - Mobile app analytics allows for development of apps which will attract high user engagement, increasing app revenue

- There are approximately 2 million iOS apps available on the App Store and 2.1 million Android apps on the Google Play store (Sept. 2018)
    - Android holds about 53.2% of the smartphone market, while iOS is 43%
    
- To understand which apps attract users in both markets I will analyze two freely available data sets (using Python):
    - Google Play Store Apps
        - This data set contains more than 10,000 Google Play mobile applications details
        - Web scraping tools were used to extract data from the Google Play store
        - You can download this data set [here](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps)
        
    - Mobile App Statistics (Apple iOS app store)
        - This data set contains more than 7,000 Apple iOS mobile applications details
        - R and linux web scraping tools were used to extract data from the iTunes Search API at the Apple Inc website
